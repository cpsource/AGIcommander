Iâ€™ve attached README-commander.md and commander.py.
Please update README-commander.md to reflect all current command-line switches and functionality in the latest commander.py.
Specifically, make sure the -m switch and any other undocumented options are clearly included, with explanations and usage examples where appropriate.
Ensure the README is accurate, clear, and complete for users of the tool.
