Here's a clearer version of that prompt:

**Your job is to:**

1. **Analyze the attached `commander.py` file** and identify any features, command-line options, or functionality that may be missing from the current `README-commander.md` documentation.

2. **Update `README-commander.md`** to include:
   - Any new command-line switches (like `-r`, `-x`, `-y`)
   - The `.skip-commander` file functionality
   - Usage examples and explanations
   - Any other features or changes not currently documented

3. **Create the updated `README-commander.md` file** as a downloadable artifact so I can save it to my project.

**Context:** I want to ensure the README documentation is complete and matches all current functionality in the commander.py script.
