However, a centralized tool registry could offer some benefits in the future:

- **Improved discoverability:** A single place to find all available tools across different MCP servers.
- **Enhanced documentation:** A more detailed description of each tool, including usage examples and limitations.
- **Standardized interface:** A consistent way to interact with tools, regardless of their implementation.
- **Security auditing:** A central point for reviewing and approving new tools before they are added to the system.

If a tool registry were implemented, it would contain entries like this:

```json
[
  {
    "tool": "modify_codebase",
    "server": "commander",
    "description": "Modifies code in multiple files based on AI instructions.",
    "request_format": "{\"tool\": \"modify_codebase\", \"arguments\": {\"instructions\": \"...\", \"file_patterns\": \"...\"}}",
    "response_format": "{\"status\": \"success\", \"modified_files\": [\"...\"]}"
  },
  {
    "tool": "web_research",
    "server": "research",
    "description": "Researches a topic using web search and synthesis.",
    "request_format": "{\"tool\": \"web_research\", \"arguments\": {\"topic\": \"...\"}}",
    "response_format": "{\"status\": \"success\", \"summary\": \"...\", \"sources\": [\"...\"]}"
  }
]
```

For now, the dynamic discovery provided by MCP is sufficient. A tool registry can be considered as a future enhancement to improve the overall usability and security of the system.
