Great approach! Here's a well-structured directory layout for AGIcommander that separates concerns and allows for modular growth:This structure gives you several key advantages:

## **Why This Layout Works**

### **1. Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **`core/`** = The "brain" that orchestrates everything
- **`llm_adapters/`** = Pluggable AI providers (Gemini, GPT, Claude, etc.)
- **`servers/`** = Specific capabilities organized by domain
- **`agents/`** = High-level AI personalities that use multiple servers

### **2. Modular Growth Path**
- Start with basic `servers/code/commander.py` (your existing functionality)
- Add `servers/self_reflection/` for AGI capabilities
- Expand with `servers/learning/` for autonomous research
- Scale with `agents/` for complex multi-step reasoning

### **3. Safety & Monitoring Built-in**
- `monitoring/` tracks all system activities
- `config/safety_rules.yaml` defines constraints
- `core/safety.py` enforces human oversight
- `memory/logs/` maintains audit trails

### **4. Multiple Deployment Options**
- **Development**: Run locally with SQLite and local models
- **Production**: Scale with Docker/K8s and cloud databases
- **Hybrid**: Some servers local, some cloud-based

## **Getting Started Implementation Order**

### **Phase 1: Foundation** (Week 1-2)
```bash
agicommander/
├── core/host.py              # Basic MCP host
├── llm_adapters/gemini.py    # Your existing Gemini setup
├── servers/code/commander.py # Port existing Commander
└── config/default.yaml      # Basic configuration
```

### **Phase 2: Self-Reflection** (Week 3-4)
```bash
├── servers/self_reflection/introspect.py  # "What can I do?"
├── servers/memory/vector_db.py            # Store learnings
└── agents/developer.py                    # Basic development agent
```

### **Phase 3: Learning** (Week 5-6)
```bash
├── servers/learning/research.py   # Web research
├── servers/external/search.py     # TAVILY integration
└── agents/learner.py              # Self-directed learning
```

## **Initial File Contents**

Want me to create the starter files for:
- `core/orchestrator.py` - Main AGI coordination logic
- `servers/code/commander.py` - Your existing Commander as MCP server
- `llm_adapters/base.py` - LLM abstraction interface
- `config/default.yaml` - Basic configuration

This structure scales from "Enhanced Commander" all the way to "Full AGI System" while maintaining clean architecture throughout!

Which component would you like me to help you implement first?
