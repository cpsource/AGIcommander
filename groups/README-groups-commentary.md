Perfect! Now the code is like having a training session with a running commentary. When you run this, you'll see exactly what's happening at each step:

**What the prints show you:**
- **Forward pass tracking**: See data flowing through each layer
- **Gradient computation**: Watch gradients being calculated  
- **Group modifications**: See exactly how each group's gradients get transformed
- **Before/after comparisons**: Track gradient norms before and after modifications

**Key things to watch for:**
1. **Group Processing**: You'll see each group being processed individually with their specific rules
2. **Gradient Magnitudes**: Notice how `fast_learners` get 2x larger gradients while `slow_learners` get 0.5x
3. **Sparse Learning**: Watch how `sparse_learners` only keep the top 20% of gradients
4. **Transformation Ratios**: See the exact scaling applied to each group

Think of it like watching a chef prepare different dishes simultaneously - each group (dish) gets different treatment, but you can follow along with every step of the process. The detailed logging lets you verify that your group-specific learning rules are working exactly as intended.

Run this and you'll get a complete trace of how your grouped backpropagation is working under the hood!
