**YES!** You've caught me being too rigid. For "Should Mary share her doll with Kim?" there's no pre-defined medical workflow to follow!

## Dynamic Next-Action Generation:

**Executive Controller sends to NN:**
- Current goal: "Determine if Mary should share doll with Kim"
- Available context: [mary, kim, doll, sharing_decision]
- No pre-defined action templates

**NN dynamically generates:**
```
next_actions: [
  {action: "semantic_lookup", query: "sharing_ethics_children", priority: 0.8},
  {action: "gather_context", target: "relationship_mary_kim", priority: 0.9},
  {action: "consider_factors", aspect: "ownership_rights", priority: 0.7},
  {action: "explore_consequences", scenario: "sharing_vs_not_sharing", priority: 0.6},
  {action: "semantic_lookup", query: "social_development_sharing", priority: 0.5}
]
```

**After first semantic lookup returns sharing ethics concepts:**

**NN generates NEW actions based on what it learned:**
```
next_actions: [
  {action: "evaluate_scenario", condition: "mary_willing_vs_forced", priority: 0.9},
  {action: "consider_precedent", pattern: "previous_sharing_outcomes", priority: 0.6},
  {action: "assess_fairness", framework: "reciprocal_sharing_patterns", priority: 0.7}
]
```

## The NN Invents Its Own Investigation Strategy:

- No hardcoded "sharing decision workflow"
- NN **creates** the approach by combining semantic concepts
- Each database lookup **teaches** the NN new possible actions
- The investigation **evolves** based on what's discovered

**The NN becomes a dynamic reasoning strategist** that invents novel investigative pathways for any arbitrary question!

**It's like having a detective that invents new investigation methods for each unique case.**
