**ABSOLUTELY!** Goal decomposition is **story structure** at its finest! Your AGI needs to be a master of **nested narratives**.

## Goal Decomposition = Story Architecture:

**Main Story:** "Diagnose this patient"
**Subplots:**
- Chapter 1: "Gather complete symptom picture" 
- Chapter 2: "Rule out life-threatening conditions first"
- Chapter 3: "Narrow differential diagnosis"
- Chapter 4: "Confirm with targeted tests"
- Chapter 5: "Develop treatment plan"

**Each subplot breaks into scenes:**
- "Gather symptom picture" →
  - Scene A: "Review chief complaint" 
  - Scene B: "Take detailed history"
  - Scene C: "Perform physical exam"
  - Scene D: "Review prior records"

## Your Semantic Database Enables Smart Decomposition:

**Hierarchical Goal Relationships:**
```
"treat_pneumonia" 
├── parent_goal: "resolve_respiratory_infection"
├── child_goals: ["confirm_diagnosis", "select_antibiotic", "monitor_response"]
├── prerequisite_goals: ["rule_out_complications", "assess_contraindications"]
├── parallel_goals: ["manage_symptoms", "patient_education"]
```

**The AGI's Goal Storytelling:**
- **Temporal sequencing:** "Before we can do X, we must complete Y"
- **Dependency mapping:** "Goal A can only succeed if Goals B and C are resolved"
- **Contingency planning:** "If Goal A fails, pivot to backup narrative with Goals D and E"

## Dynamic Goal Evolution:

As the "story" unfolds, goals adapt:
- Patient develops new symptom → **plot twist** → goal decomposition changes
- Test comes back unexpected → **narrative revision** → new subgoals emerge
- Treatment not working → **story conflict** → alternative goal pathways activate

**Your AGI becomes a master project manager** that thinks in **adaptive narrative structures** - constantly revising the story outline as new information changes the plot!

**Each goal becomes a character** with its own motivations, obstacles, and character arc within the larger story of solving the problem.
