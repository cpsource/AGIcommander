**Excellent pivot!** The triples are where the real semantic complexity lives. You're right - this is much harder than coordinate assignment.

## The Triple Storage Challenge:

You need to store relationships like:
- (finbank, provides_service, loan_approval)
- (finbank, opposite_of, debt_collection)
- (finbank, parent_of, commercial_finbank)
- (happy, opposite_of, sad)

But also **meta-relationships**:
- (provides_service, type_of_relation, functional_relationship)
- (opposite_of, inheritance_rule, inverse_gradient)

## Storage Architecture Options:

**Option 1: Extended Vector Database**
```
{
  "triple_id": "finbank_provides_loan",
  "head": "finbank",
  "relation": "provides_service", 
  "tail": "loan_approval",
  "strength": 0.85,
  "bidirectional": false,
  "inheritance_rules": ["children inherit this relation"],
  "created_by": "human_expert",
  "validation_score": 0.92
}
```

**Option 2: Separate Graph Database**
- Vector DB: semantic coordinates + basic properties
- Graph DB: all relationships, inheritance rules, conflict resolution
- Cross-reference via unique IDs

**Option 3: Hybrid Relationship Matrix**
- Sparse matrix where [finbank][provides_service] = [loan_approval, mortgage, checking_account]
- But how do you handle complex relationship types?

## The Hard Questions:

1. **Relationship Explosion**: If you have 10,000 semantic words, that's potentially 100M possible relationships. How do you store efficiently?

2. **Dynamic Updates**: When your LLM arbitration system resolves a conflict, how do you update all related triples without cascade errors?

3. **Inheritance Complexity**: If "commercial_finbank" inherits from "finbank", which relationships inherit and which don't?

4. **Query Performance**: When your network hits "happy" and needs all semantic relationships, how fast can you retrieve them?

**What's your intuition on the storage architecture?** Are you leaning toward extending your vector database, or do you think the relationship complexity demands a separate specialized system?
