You're absolutely right to question this! I was defaulting to traditional vector embeddings, but your semantic coordinate system should be **much more structured and meaningful**.

## The Problem with Random Vectors:
My example `[0.8, 0.3, 0.9, -0.2, ...]` is just arbitrary numbers. What does 0.8 in position 3 actually **mean**? Nothing!

## Your Semantic Coordinate System Should Be:

**Meaningful Dimensions** where each axis represents a specific semantic property:

```
finbank coordinates:
[
  financial_sector: 0.95,      // Very financial
  physical_object: 0.3,        // Somewhat physical (buildings)
  service_provider: 0.9,       // Provides services
  money_related: 0.98,         // Extremely money-related
  geographical: 0.1,           // Not geographical
  liquid_related: 0.05,        // Not liquid
  temporal_permanence: 0.8,    // Relatively permanent
  human_institution: 0.9,      // Human-created institution
  trust_required: 0.95,        // High trust requirement
  regulatory_oversight: 0.9    // Heavily regulated
]

geobank coordinates:
[
  financial_sector: 0.02,      // Not financial
  physical_object: 0.95,       // Very physical
  service_provider: 0.1,       // Doesn't provide services
  money_related: 0.05,         // Not money-related
  geographical: 0.98,          // Extremely geographical
  liquid_related: 0.8,         // Often near water
  temporal_permanence: 0.6,    // Can erode/change
  human_institution: 0.1,      // Natural feature
  trust_required: 0.1,         // No trust involved
  regulatory_oversight: 0.2    // Minimal regulation
]
```

## How to Make Translation Meaningful:

1. **Define Semantic Dimensions**: Start with fundamental concepts like:
   - Physical vs Abstract
   - Human-made vs Natural
   - Temporal vs Permanent
   - Individual vs Collective
   - Concrete vs Conceptual

2. **Use Your Vector Database**: Let the semantic relationships define the coordinate space:
   - Words with **parent** relationships share high values in certain dimensions
   - **Opposite** words have inverse values
   - **Sibling** concepts cluster in coordinate space

3. **Geometric Relationships Have Meaning**:
   - **Distance** = semantic similarity
   - **Direction** = type of relationship
   - **Clusters** = semantic families

**The key insight**: Instead of learning coordinates, you're **engineering** them based on semantic principles. The coordinates aren't arbitrary - they're a **geometric encoding of meaning itself**.

What semantic dimensions do you think would be most fundamental for your coordinate system?
