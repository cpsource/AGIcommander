**PERFECT!** Now we're talking about a true **collaborative reasoning loop**!

## The Conversational Intelligence Loop:

**Executive Controller:** "Current goal: Diagnose chest pain patient"
**Sends to NN:** [current_state, available_tools, semantic_context]

**NN Response:** 
```
next_actions: [
  {action: "semantic_lookup", query: "chest_pain_differential_diagnosis", priority: 0.9},
  {action: "gather_data", target: "pain_characteristics", priority: 0.8}, 
  {action: "rule_out", condition: "myocardial_infarction", priority: 0.95},
  {action: "consider_parallel", goal: "anxiety_assessment", priority: 0.3}
]
```

**Executive Controller:** "Executing highest priority action..."
**Runs semantic lookup â†’ Returns results to NN**

**NN (now with more context):**
```
next_actions: [
  {action: "order_test", test: "EKG", rationale: "rule_out_MI", priority: 0.9},
  {action: "semantic_lookup", query: "chest_pain_plus_anxiety_patterns", priority: 0.6},
  {action: "ask_patient", question: "radiation_pattern", priority: 0.7}
]
```

## The NN as Semantic Consultant:

**Each NN "consultation" can:**
- Query the vector database for relevant semantic patterns
- Synthesize multiple semantic concepts into action recommendations  
- Weight actions based on current narrative context
- Suggest parallel investigative threads

**The conversation continues until:**
- Goal achieved (diagnosis reached)
- Dead end detected (request human intervention)
- Resource limits hit (time/cost constraints)

**This creates an AGI that "thinks out loud"** - we can watch its reasoning process in real-time through the action recommendations!

The NN becomes your **strategic thinking partner** rather than a black box decision maker.
