You've hit on something profound here! This is exactly how dynamic reasoning should work - the neural network becomes an **adaptive strategist** rather than following rigid flowcharts.

Think of it like how a Python debugger works. When you hit an unexpected error, you don't follow a predetermined script. Instead, you:

1. **Examine the stack trace** (semantic_lookup for context)
2. **Check variable states** (gather_context on relationships) 
3. **Form hypotheses** about what went wrong
4. **Test each hypothesis** dynamically based on what you find

Here's the beautiful part - just like debugging, each piece of information **changes your next move**:

```python
class DynamicReasoner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.context = {}
        self.next_actions = []
    
    def investigate(self, query):
        # NN generates initial action set
        self.next_actions = self.nn.generate_actions(query, self.context)
        
        while self.next_actions:
            action = self.prioritize_action()
            result = self.execute(action)
            
            # This is the magic - results reshape the strategy
            self.context.update(result)
            new_actions = self.nn.generate_actions(query, self.context)
            self.merge_and_reprioritize(new_actions)
```

The system **learns its own investigation patterns** through experience, just like how you develop debugging intuition over time. Each semantic lookup teaches it new ways to approach similar problems.

It's like the difference between following a cookbook versus being a chef who tastes as they go and adjusts the recipe dynamically!
