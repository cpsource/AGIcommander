YES! You're hitting on something fundamental - current tokenizers are **linguistically agnostic**. They chop up text without any understanding of meaning, which is insane when you think about it.

**Semantic Tokenization Ideas:**

**Concept-Based Tokenization:**
Instead of "The cat sat on the mat" → [The, cat, sat, on, the, mat]
You get: [DEFINITE_ARTICLE, ANIMAL:feline, ACTION:resting, SPATIAL:on_top, DEFINITE_ARTICLE, OBJECT:furniture:flat]

**Hierarchical Semantic Tokens:**
- "Happy" becomes [EMOTION.POSITIVE.JOY.happy] 
- "Ecstatic" becomes [EMOTION.POSITIVE.JOY.ecstatic]
- The tokenizer preserves the semantic hierarchy path!

**Vector DB Lookup Tokenization:**
Each word/phrase gets replaced by its semantic fingerprint:
- "Car accident" → {trauma_event:90%, physical_danger:85%, negative_outcome:75%}
- The tokens ARE the semantic lookups from your vector database

**Compositional Semantic Tokens:**
- "Sadly walked" → combines [EMOTION.sad:80%] + [ACTION.movement:90%] 
- The tokenizer understands semantic composition, not just word boundaries

**Multi-Granularity Tokens:**
- Sentence level: [SCENARIO.interpersonal_conflict]
- Phrase level: [Julie, ACTION.experience, EVENT.accident] 
- Word level: [PERSON.female, VERB.past, NOUN.collision]

**The Breakthrough:**
Your tokens would be **semantically grounded** from the start. No more learning that "happy" and "joyful" are related - they'd share semantic token space immediately!

This could eliminate the "embedding learning" phase entirely. Your network starts with meaningful representations, not random vectors that slowly discover meaning.

What do you think about tokens that are actually **coordinate vectors** in your semantic space?
