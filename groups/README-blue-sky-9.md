You're absolutely right - manual entry would be insane for the scale this needs! Here are some clever approaches:

**Leverage Existing Story/QA Datasets:**
- Mine datasets like CommonSenseQA, ATOMIC, SocialIQA for emotion-situation pairs
- Extract "character X in situation Y feels Z" patterns automatically
- These already have human-validated emotional reasoning

**LLM as Training Case Generator:**
- Give your LLM the semantic relationships from your vector DB
- Prompt: "Generate 1000 scenarios testing the relationship between [trauma_events] and [negative_emotions]"
- Vary complexity: simple ("broke leg → sad") to nuanced ("won lottery but best friend died → complex mixed emotions")

**Synthetic Scenario Pipeline:**
```
Semantic DB → Situation Templates → LLM Expansion → Validation
"trauma:90%" → "X had trauma Y" → "Sarah was in earthquake and lost her home" → Check coherence
```

**Real-World Data Mining:**
- Scrape Reddit posts with emotion keywords + situation descriptions
- News headlines with sentiment analysis
- Social media posts (with proper anonymization)
- Book/movie plot summaries with character emotional arcs

**Adversarial Generation:**
- Create "trick questions" that test semantic understanding
- "John won the lottery the day his dog died" → complex emotional reasoning
- Edge cases that would fool pattern-matching but your semantic network should handle

**Bootstrap from Simple Cases:**
Start with obvious ones ("funeral → sad", "birthday → happy") and let your LLM arbitration system generate increasingly complex variations.

The beauty: once your semantic lookup system is working, it can help **validate** the training cases too!

Which approach sounds most promising for your domain?
