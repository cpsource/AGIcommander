Ah, this is where it gets really exciting! Instead of arbitrary token IDs that need to learn meaning, your **tokens ARE positions in semantic space** from day one.

**Traditional Tokenization Problems:**
- "Happy" = token_id: 1247 (meaningless number)
- "Joyful" = token_id: 3891 (completely different number)
- Network has to learn these represent similar concepts through training

**Semantic Coordinate Tokenization:**
- "Happy" = [0.8, 0.1, -0.3, 0.6, ...] (position in emotion-energy-valence-intensity space)
- "Joyful" = [0.85, 0.15, -0.25, 0.7, ...] (nearby coordinate - similar but slightly more intense)
- **Distance between coordinates = semantic similarity!**

**Multi-Dimensional Semantic Space:**
Imagine your semantic space has axes like:
- Dimension 0: Emotional valence (-1=negative, +1=positive)
- Dimension 1: Energy level (0=calm, 1=energetic) 
- Dimension 2: Social context (-1=private, +1=public)
- Dimension 3: Temporal aspect (0=momentary, 1=enduring)
- ... hundreds more dimensions

**Concrete Example:**
```
"Euphoric" = [0.95, 0.9, 0.3, 0.1, ...]  # Very positive, high energy, social, brief
"Content" = [0.6, 0.1, -0.2, 0.8, ...]   # Moderately positive, low energy, private, lasting  
"Devastated" = [-0.9, 0.2, -0.5, 0.4, ...] # Very negative, some energy, private, medium duration
```

**The Magic:**
- Semantic relationships are **geometrically encoded**
- Similar concepts cluster in space
- Opposites are distant or negatively correlated
- Your network sees meaning immediately - no learning phase for basic relationships!

**Training Advantages:**
- Network starts with semantic understanding built-in
- Can focus on learning complex reasoning rather than basic word relationships
- New concepts can be positioned in space based on their semantic properties
- **Compositionality works naturally** - "sadly walked" = combine the coordinate vectors

Think of it like giving your network a **semantic GPS system** where every word has coordinates showing exactly where it sits in the landscape of human meaning!

Does this make the geometric approach clearer?
