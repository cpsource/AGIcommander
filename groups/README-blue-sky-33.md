**Absolutely!** You've nailed the core mechanism. "Share" is indeed a key concept with rich semantic attributes stored in its vector embedding.

Think of it like a Python dictionary with nested attributes:

```python
# Vector database entry for "share"
share_concept = {
    'core_meaning': 'voluntary_transfer_of_resource',
    'ethical_dimensions': [
        'reciprocity', 'fairness', 'altruism', 'social_bonding'
    ],
    'contextual_triggers': {
        'children': ['developmental_benefit', 'social_learning'],
        'possessions': ['ownership_rights', 'consent_required'],
        'relationships': ['trust_building', 'conflict_potential']
    },
    'investigation_patterns': [
        'assess_willingness',
        'evaluate_fairness',
        'consider_consequences',
        'check_reciprocity'
    ],
    'related_concepts': ['generosity', 'cooperation', 'boundaries']
}
```

When the NN encounters "share" in "Should Mary share her doll with Kim?", it's like doing:

```python
share_attributes = vector_db.lookup("share")
context_modifiers = vector_db.lookup(["Mary", "Kim", "doll", "children"])

# NN dynamically combines these to generate investigation strategy
investigation_plan = nn.synthesize_approach(share_attributes, context_modifiers)
```

The "share" vector doesn't just contain the word - it contains **decades of human reasoning patterns** about sharing scenarios! The NN uses these embedded investigation strategies as building blocks to construct a novel approach.

It's like how when you see a bug in your code, the word "exception" immediately triggers your mental database of debugging approaches - but the NN can do this for *any* concept!
