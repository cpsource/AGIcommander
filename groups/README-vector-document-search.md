Great question! The difference between inner product and cosine similarity is subtle but important - it's like the difference between "how much do these vectors agree?" vs "how similar are their directions?"

## Mathematical Difference

**Inner Product**: `a · b = a₁×b₁ + a₂×b₂ + a₃×b₃`
**Cosine Similarity**: `cos(θ) = (a · b) / (|a| × |b|)`

Think of it this way:

```python
import numpy as np

# Two vectors with same direction, different magnitudes
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])        # magnitude ≈ 3.74
b = np.array([2, 4, 6])        # magnitude ≈ 7.48 (2x larger)

# Inner product considers magnitude
inner_product = np.dot(a, b)           # = 28 (high because b is large)

# Cosine only considers direction
cosine_sim = np.dot(a, b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))  # = 1.0 (perfect direction match)
```

## Key Differences in Practice

### **1. Magnitude Sensitivity**

**Inner Product**:
```python
# Document embeddings
short_doc = [0.1, 0.2, 0.1]      # Short document, small values
long_doc = [1.0, 2.0, 1.0]       # Long document, large values  
query = [0.5, 1.0, 0.5]

# Inner product favors longer documents
print(np.dot(query, short_doc))   # 0.25
print(np.dot(query, long_doc))    # 2.5 (much higher!)
```

**Cosine Distance**:
```python
# Cosine treats both equally - only cares about topic similarity
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

print(cosine_similarity([query], [short_doc]))  # ~1.0
print(cosine_similarity([query], [long_doc]))   # ~1.0 (same!)
```

### **2. When Vectors Are Normalized**

If your vectors are **normalized to length 1** (like OpenAI embeddings), inner product and cosine become equivalent:

```python
# OpenAI embeddings are pre-normalized
openai_embedding_1 = [0.5, 0.5, 0.707]  # |v| = 1
openai_embedding_2 = [0.6, 0.8, 0.0]    # |v| = 1

# For normalized vectors: inner_product = cosine_similarity
inner = np.dot(openai_embedding_1, openai_embedding_2)
cosine = cosine_similarity([openai_embedding_1], [openai_embedding_2])[0][0]
print(f"Inner: {inner:.3f}, Cosine: {cosine:.3f}")  # Nearly identical
```

## PostgreSQL pgvector Implementation

```sql
-- Inner product (pgvector uses negative because PostgreSQL sorts ascending)
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <#> '[0.5,1.0,0.5]' LIMIT 5;

-- Cosine distance
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <=> '[0.5,1.0,0.5]' LIMIT 5;
```

## Use Case Guidelines

### **Use Inner Product When:**

**1. Working with normalized embeddings (OpenAI, Sentence Transformers)**
```python
# OpenAI embeddings are already normalized
openai_embedding = openai.Embedding.create(...)['data'][0]['embedding']

# Inner product is faster and equivalent to cosine
results = store.similarity_search(
    query_embedding=query_embedding,
    # Use <#> operator in SQL for speed
)
```

**2. You want to favor "stronger" signals**
```python
# E.g., TF-IDF vectors where magnitude matters
doc1_tfidf = [0.1, 0.05, 0.02]  # Few relevant terms
doc2_tfidf = [0.8, 0.9, 0.7]    # Many relevant terms

# Inner product will favor doc2 (stronger signal)
# Cosine would treat them more equally
```

### **Use Cosine When:**

**1. Document similarity regardless of length**
```python
# Compare tweet vs. research paper on same topic
tweet_embedding = [0.1, 0.2, 0.1]      # Short content
paper_embedding = [1.0, 2.0, 1.0]      # Long content

# Cosine focuses on topic similarity, ignoring length
```

**2. Vectors aren't normalized**
```python
# Custom embeddings with varying magnitudes
user_profile = [50, 100, 25]    # User preferences (raw counts)
product_features = [5, 8, 2]    # Product attributes

# Cosine normalizes the comparison
```

## Performance Comparison

```python
# Benchmark with normalized vectors (OpenAI style)
import time

normalized_vectors = [normalize(v) for v in vectors]

# Inner product (faster)
start = time.time()
results_inner = [np.dot(query, v) for v in normalized_vectors]
inner_time = time.time() - start

# Cosine (slower due to norm calculations)
start = time.time()
results_cosine = [cosine_similarity([query], [v])[0][0] for v in vectors]
cosine_time = time.time() - start

print(f"Inner product: {inner_time:.4f}s")
print(f"Cosine: {cosine_time:.4f}s")
# Inner product is typically 2-3x faster for normalized vectors
```

## Real-World Example

```python
def choose_similarity_metric(embedding_source: str):
    if embedding_source in ["openai", "sentence-transformers", "huggingface"]:
        # These are pre-normalized, use inner product for speed
        return "inner_product"
    elif embedding_source in ["tfidf", "word2vec", "custom"]:
        # These vary in magnitude, use cosine for fairness
        return "cosine"
    else:
        # When in doubt, cosine is safer
        return "cosine"

# In your vector store
def similarity_search(self, query_embedding, metric="auto"):
    if metric == "auto":
        # For normalized embeddings, inner product is faster and equivalent
        if self._is_normalized(query_embedding):
            sql_operator = "<#>"  # inner product
        else:
            sql_operator = "<=>"  # cosine distance
    
    # Build query with appropriate operator...
```

## Bottom Line

- **OpenAI embeddings**: Use inner product (`<#>`) - it's faster and equivalent
- **Custom/TF-IDF vectors**: Use cosine (`<=>`) - it's more fair across different magnitudes
- **When unsure**: Cosine is the safer default

The key insight: cosine similarity normalizes away magnitude differences, while inner product preserves them. Choose based on whether magnitude is meaningful signal or noise in your use case!
