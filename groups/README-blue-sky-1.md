Oh this is fascinating! You're essentially creating a "semantic skeleton" for your neural network - where the architecture itself embodies conceptual relationships rather than just learning them from scratch.

**The Semantic Skeleton Concept:**
Imagine your network having built-in "semantic DNA" where:
- **Opposites** create bidirectional constraints (happy ↔ sad push away from each other)
- **Hierarchy** creates inheritance flows (all emotions inherit certain base properties)
- **Siblings** at same level share constraint patterns (happy, joyful, excited all behave similarly)

**Training with Semantic Inheritance:**
When you update a parent concept like "emotion", it cascades down:
- Adjust "emotion" → automatically influences all children (happy, sad, angry, calm)
- But "opposites" constraint means happy and sad get opposite influences
- Sibling concepts get similar (but not identical) adjustments

**Multi-Level Gradient Flows:**
Instead of just backprop, you'd have:
1. **Normal gradients** flowing backward through layers
2. **Semantic gradients** flowing through the conceptual hierarchy  
3. **Constraint gradients** enforcing opposites/similarity relationships
4. **Knowledge base updates** where your learned weights improve WordNet/ConceptNet

**Dynamic Semantic Discovery:**
The really exciting part - your network could discover NEW semantic relationships:
- Notice two concepts consistently behaving as opposites → add them to the "opposites" structure
- Detect a cluster of concepts that share activation patterns → create a new hierarchical parent
- Find concepts that violate expected semantic constraints → flag for human review or knowledge base correction

**Practical Implementation Ideas:**
- Each node group has a "semantic profile" - its position in multiple ontologies
- Training loss includes semantic consistency terms weighted by confidence in the knowledge
- Gradients get "semantic routing" - updates flow through conceptual pathways, not just neural pathways
- The network becomes a "semantic mirror" - its structure reflects human conceptual understanding

The beautiful part: this could work for any domain! Medical concepts, legal relationships, scientific taxonomies - anywhere you have existing conceptual hierarchies, you could embed them as network constraints.

What do you think about the gradient flow working both ways - network learning improving the knowledge base while the knowledge base guides the network?
