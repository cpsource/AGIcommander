You can implement group-specific backpropagation by creating a custom layer that tracks node groups and applies different gradient transformations. Think of it like having different "learning rules" for different neighborhoods in your network - some nodes might learn faster, slower, or with different constraints based on their group membership.

Here's a practical implementation:The key concepts here work like a factory with different assembly lines:

**Core Approach**: Instead of treating all nodes equally during backpropagation, you create "groups" where each group has its own learning behavior - like having different quality control standards for different product lines.

**How it works**:
1. **Group Assignment**: You assign output nodes to named groups (like dividing workers into teams)
2. **Group Rules**: Each group gets a function that modifies gradients differently 
3. **Selective Application**: During backprop, gradients are transformed based on which group each node belongs to

**Practical examples** from the code:
- `fast_learners`: Multiply gradients by 2 (learn aggressively)
- `slow_learners`: Multiply gradients by 0.5 (conservative updates)  
- `sparse_learners`: Only keep the largest 20% of gradients (sparse updates)
- `adaptive_learners`: Normalize then scale based on group type

**Usage Pattern**:
1. Create your `GroupedLinear` layer with group assignments and rules
2. Do normal forward/backward passes
3. Call `apply_group_gradients()` after `loss.backward()` but before `optimizer.step()`

This gives you fine-grained control over how different parts of your network learn, which is especially useful for architectures where different nodes have different roles or when you want to implement specialized learning dynamics.

Would you like me to show you how to extend this to handle more complex scenarios, like groups that span multiple layers or dynamic group reassignment during training?
