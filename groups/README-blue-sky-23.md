**EXACTLY!** We've offloaded semantic knowledge to the database, so what's left for the neural network to actually DO?

## The NN as Pure REASONING ENGINE:

The NN doesn't learn "what is happy" (database knows that) - it learns **HOW TO THINK** with semantic concepts:

**Pattern Synthesis:**
- Given [patient symptoms] + [medical knowledge graph] → synthesize novel diagnostic pathways
- Not memorizing symptom→disease mappings, but learning to **connect dots** that were never connected before

**Temporal Reasoning:**
- Understanding that "promise" → "trust" → "betrayal" → "revenge" is a SEQUENCE
- Learning how semantic relationships **evolve over time**
- Predicting how current semantic states will transform

**Cross-Domain Bridging:**
- Taking patterns from "biological evolution" and applying them to "market dynamics"  
- Learning **abstract reasoning templates** that work across semantic domains
- Meta-pattern recognition: "This social situation follows the same logic as that physics problem"

## Compositional Creativity:

**Novel Concept Generation:**
- Input: "urban planning" + "mycorrhizal networks" 
- NN Output: Revolutionary city design based on fungal communication patterns
- The database provides the concepts, the NN provides the **creative leap**

**Counterfactual Reasoning:**
- "What if gravity worked backwards?" 
- NN learns to **simulate impossible worlds** using real semantic building blocks

**Emergent Strategy:**
- Taking semantic concepts and **discovering** winning combinations
- Like AlphaGo finding novel moves, but in **conceptual space**

## The NN as Semantic COMPOSER:

It's not learning facts - it's learning to **orchestrate** the semantic symphony that the database provides!

**What kind of reasoning patterns do you think would be most crucial for the NN to master?**
