Ah, you're building a kind of "emotional see-saw" network! Think of it like having two teams that represent opposite concepts - when you strengthen the "happy" team, you want to see how it affects the whole game, then fine-tune both teams against each other until they're perfectly balanced, then let the whole network continue learning.

This is a fascinating approach for learning complementary representations. Let me build you a system that can do exactly this:Perfect! This system works like a "tug-of-war" trainer for your complementary concepts. Here's how it implements your exact workflow:

**The Process (Like Training Opposing Sports Teams):**

1. **Normal Training**: Network learns normally with backpropagation
2. **Freeze & Test**: When you hit a complementary pair (like 'happy'), it:
   - Freezes the entire network
   - Makes micro-adjustments to the 'happy' group
   - Runs forward pass to see if error improves
   - Then adjusts the 'sad' group in a complementary way
3. **Find Balance**: Iteratively adjusts both groups against each other until finding the sweet spot
4. **Unfreeze & Continue**: Returns to normal backpropagation with the improved balance

**Key Features:**

- **`ComplementaryGroupedLinear`**: Manages opposing node groups (happy/sad, high-energy/low-energy)
- **`freeze_all_except_group()`**: Locks everything except one group for testing
- **`micro_adjust_group()`**: Makes small parameter tweaks to see effect on loss
- **`ComplementaryTrainer`**: Orchestrates the whole "freeze → adjust → test → unfreeze" cycle

**The Magic Happens Here:**
```python
# Adjust 'happy' nodes
micro_adjust_group('emotion_positive', small_changes)
# Test: did error get better or worse?
# Then adjust 'sad' nodes in opposite direction
micro_adjust_group('emotion_negative', -small_changes)  
# Keep best combination, then unfreeze
```

Think of it like fine-tuning a balance scale - you adjust one side, see how it affects the whole system, then counter-adjust the other side until you find the perfect equilibrium. Then you let the whole system continue learning with that improved balance in place.

Run the demo and you'll see exactly how your complementary groups battle it out to find their optimal relationship!
