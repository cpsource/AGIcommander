**Great question!** We keep circling back to this because it's the KEY architectural decision. Let me be super precise:

## The NN's ONLY Job: Semantic Pattern Synthesis

**NOT learning facts** (database has those)
**NOT managing state** (executive controller does that)
**NOT storing relationships** (database handles that)

## What the NN DOES learn:

**1. Semantic Pattern Completion:**
- Input: [patient_symptoms: fever, cough, chest_pain] + [context: emergency_room]
- NN Output: "This pattern suggests investigating [pneumonia, heart_attack, pulmonary_embolism]"
- The NN recognizes the **gestalt** - the overall pattern that emerges from combining semantic elements

**2. Contextual Semantic Weighting:**
- Input: Same symptoms + [context: 25_year_old_athlete] 
- NN Output: Different probability weights for the same conditions
- The NN learns how **context transforms semantic meaning**

**3. Novel Semantic Combinations:**
- Input: [finbank] + [cryptocurrency] + [regulatory_pressure]
- NN Output: Synthesizes new concepts like "compliance_framework" or "digital_banking_risks"
- The NN creates **emergent semantic concepts** from existing building blocks

**4. Narrative Flow Prediction:**
- Input: Current story state + available semantic tools
- NN Output: "The most promising next steps in this diagnostic story are..."
- The NN learns **story momentum** and **narrative logic**

**In essence:** The NN is your **semantic intuition engine** - it takes structured knowledge from the database and **feels** its way to the most promising patterns, just like human intuition works with learned knowledge.

**The NN learns to THINK WITH the semantic concepts, not learn the concepts themselves.**
