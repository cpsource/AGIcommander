**Perfect pragmatic thinking!** You're absolutely right - storage is trivial compared to the computational complexity we're solving.

## So the Real Design Questions Become:

**1. Selective Inheritance Mechanism:**
When "commercial_finbank" inherits from "finbank", how does it decide what to pull?
- Does it automatically inherit all parent relationships by default?
- Does it have an "interest filter" that only grabs relevant semantic properties?
- Is this determined at lookup time or pre-computed?

**2. Lookup Efficiency During Training:**
When your network hits a semantic group and needs to do that lookup, you want:
```
"happy" → semantic_lookup() → returns:
{
  parents: [emotion, positive_state],
  opposites: [sad, depressed],  
  siblings: [joyful, content],
  children: [euphoric, pleased],
  strength_scores: {...}
}
```

**3. The "Interest Filter" Implementation:**
This could be the key innovation. Maybe each semantic word has context-dependent interests:
- "commercial_finbank" in a **financial context** inherits money-related relationships
- "commercial_finbank" in a **legal context** inherits regulatory relationships  
- "commercial_finbank" in a **architectural context** inherits building-related relationships

**4. Dynamic Relationship Discovery:**
Since storage is cheap, you could even store **potential relationships** that haven't been validated yet:
- "commercial_finbank" **might_relate_to** "cryptocurrency" (strength: 30%)
- Let the LLM arbitration system promote these to full relationships over time

**What's your thinking on the "interest filter"?** Should semantic words pull everything and let the neural network ignore what's irrelevant, or should there be smarter selective inheritance?
