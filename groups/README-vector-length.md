Great question! Vector length (dimensionality) depends heavily on your **use case** and **embedding model**. Let me break down the practical considerations:

## Common Vector Dimensions by Use Case

### **Text Embeddings (Most Common)**

```python
# Real-world embedding models and their dimensions:

# OpenAI (most popular)
openai_ada_002 = 1536  # text-embedding-ada-002
openai_3_small = 1536  # text-embedding-3-small  
openai_3_large = 3072  # text-embedding-3-large

# Sentence Transformers (popular open-source)
sentence_bert = 384    # all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (fast, good quality)
sentence_large = 768   # all-mpnet-base-v2 (better quality)

# Cohere
cohere_embed = 4096    # embed-english-v3.0

# Google
google_palm = 768      # textembedding-gecko

# Smaller, specialized models
word2vec = 300         # Classic word embeddings
fasttext = 300         # Facebook's FastText
```

### **Image Embeddings**

```python
# Image models tend to be larger
resnet50 = 2048        # ResNet-50 final layer
clip_vision = 512      # CLIP vision encoder
efficientnet = 1280    # EfficientNet-B7
```

### **Code Embeddings**

```python
# Code-specific models
codebert = 768         # Microsoft CodeBERT
unixcoder = 768        # UniXcoder
```

## pgvector Practical Limits

From the README, pgvector supports:

```sql
-- Standard vector type
CREATE TABLE items (embedding vector(2000));  -- Up to 2,000 dimensions

-- Half-precision vectors (more efficient)
CREATE TABLE items (embedding halfvec(4000)); -- Up to 4,000 dimensions

-- Binary vectors (for quantized embeddings)
CREATE TABLE items (embedding bit(64000));    -- Up to 64,000 dimensions
```

## Performance vs Quality Trade-offs

Think of vector dimensions like image resolution - more dimensions = better quality but slower processing:

```python
# Performance comparison (approximate)
dimensions_performance = {
    128:  "‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° Lightning fast, basic quality",
    256:  "‚ö°‚ö° Very fast, decent quality", 
    384:  "‚ö° Fast, good quality (sweet spot for many uses)",
    768:  "üêå Moderate speed, high quality",
    1536: "üêåüêå Slower, excellent quality (OpenAI standard)",
    3072: "üêåüêåüêå Slow, premium quality"
}
```

## Practical Recommendations

### **For Your Word Vectors (bank-money, etc.)**

If you're creating **custom word concept vectors**, I'd recommend **384 dimensions** as a sweet spot:

```python
# Custom concept embeddings - good balance
bank_money_384 = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...] * 384  # 384 dimensions
river_bank_384 = [0.05, 0.1, 0.8, ...] * 384

# Pros:
# ‚úÖ Fast similarity search
# ‚úÖ Reasonable memory usage  
# ‚úÖ Good expressiveness for concepts
# ‚úÖ Popular size (many models use this)
```

### **If Using Pre-trained Models**

**Use whatever the model outputs** - don't try to resize:

```python
# If using OpenAI
openai_embedding = openai.Embedding.create(...)  # 1536 dimensions
# Just use 1536, don't compress

# If using Sentence Transformers
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')  # 384 dimensions
embedding = model.encode("bank money")  # Use 384
```

## Memory and Storage Impact

```python
# Storage requirements per vector
def calculate_storage(dimensions, num_vectors):
    """Calculate storage needs"""
    
    # PostgreSQL storage (4 bytes per dimension + 8 bytes overhead)
    pg_bytes_per_vector = (4 * dimensions) + 8
    
    # Total for PostgreSQL
    total_pg_mb = (pg_bytes_per_vector * num_vectors) / (1024 * 1024)
    
    return {
        'dimensions': dimensions,
        'bytes_per_vector': pg_bytes_per_vector,
        'total_mb_for_1M_vectors': total_pg_mb,
        'total_gb_for_1M_vectors': total_pg_mb / 1024
    }

# Compare different sizes
for dims in [128, 256, 384, 768, 1536]:
    stats = calculate_storage(dims, 1_000_000)
    print(f"{dims:4d} dims: {stats['total_gb_for_1M_vectors']:.1f} GB for 1M vectors")

# Output:
# 128 dims: 0.5 GB for 1M vectors
# 256 dims: 1.0 GB for 1M vectors  
# 384 dims: 1.5 GB for 1M vectors ‚Üê Sweet spot
# 768 dims: 2.9 GB for 1M vectors
# 1536 dims: 5.8 GB for 1M vectors
```

## Index Performance by Dimension

```python
# HNSW index build time (approximate)
index_build_time = {
    128:  "5 minutes for 1M vectors",
    256:  "8 minutes for 1M vectors",
    384:  "12 minutes for 1M vectors",  # Still reasonable
    768:  "25 minutes for 1M vectors", 
    1536: "50+ minutes for 1M vectors"  # Getting slow
}

# Query speed (approximate)
query_speed = {
    128:  "< 1ms per query",
    256:  "< 2ms per query", 
    384:  "< 3ms per query",    # Still very fast
    768:  "5-10ms per query",
    1536: "10-20ms per query"   # Noticeable
}
```

## Dimension Reduction Techniques

If you have high-dimensional embeddings but want speed:

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import numpy as np

# Reduce OpenAI 1536 ‚Üí 384 dimensions
def reduce_dimensions(embeddings_1536, target_dims=384):
    """Reduce dimensionality while preserving most information"""
    
    pca = PCA(n_components=target_dims)
    reduced_embeddings = pca.fit_transform(embeddings_1536)
    
    # Check how much information is preserved
    explained_variance = sum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)
    print(f"Retained {explained_variance:.1%} of original information")
    
    return reduced_embeddings

# Example: Compress for faster search
original_1536 = np.random.randn(10000, 1536)  # 10K OpenAI embeddings
compressed_384 = reduce_dimensions(original_1536, 384)

# Store compressed versions for fast search
# Keep originals for high-precision tasks
```

## My Recommendation for You

Based on your use case (word concept vectors like "bank-money"):

```python
# Recommended setup
VECTOR_DIMENSIONS = 384  # Sweet spot for custom concepts

class ConceptVectorStore:
    def __init__(self):
        self.embedding_dim = 384  # Good balance of speed + expressiveness
        
    def create_concept_vector(self, concept_name, related_words, weights):
        """Create a 384-dimensional concept vector"""
        # Your logic to create meaningful 384-dim vectors
        vector = self.build_concept_embedding(related_words, weights, dim=384)
        return vector

# PostgreSQL setup
CREATE TABLE concept_vectors (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    concept_name TEXT,
    embedding vector(384),  -- 384 dimensions
    metadata JSONB
);

# Fast HNSW index
CREATE INDEX ON concept_vectors 
USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

**Why 384 is the sweet spot:**
- ‚úÖ Fast enough for real-time search
- ‚úÖ Expressive enough for complex concepts  
- ‚úÖ Memory efficient (1.5GB per million vectors)
- ‚úÖ Popular size (many production systems use this)
- ‚úÖ Good pgvector performance
- ‚úÖ Room to grow your concept complexity

Start with 384, and only go higher if you need the extra expressiveness!
