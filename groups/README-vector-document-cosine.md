Great question! "Normalizing to one" means adjusting the vector so its length (magnitude) equals exactly 1.0, while preserving its direction. Think of it like converting arrows of different lengths to unit arrows that all have the same length but point in their original directions.

## What is Vector Normalization?

**Vector length (magnitude)**: `|v| = √(v₁² + v₂² + v₃² + ...)`

```python
import numpy as np

# Your word vector
bank_money_vector = [1.2, 0.6, 0.8, 0.3]

# Calculate current length
length = np.linalg.norm(bank_money_vector)
print(f"Current length: {length:.3f}")  # ~1.538

# Normalize to length 1
normalized = bank_money_vector / length
print(f"Normalized: {normalized}")      # [0.78, 0.39, 0.52, 0.195]
print(f"New length: {np.linalg.norm(normalized):.3f}")  # 1.000
```

## Python Analogy

Think of it like standardizing different-sized photos to the same resolution while keeping their content proportions:

```python
# Like resizing images to same dimensions
original_image = [1200, 800]  # width, height
target_size = 1.0

# Scale down proportionally
scale_factor = target_size / max(original_image)  # 1.0/1200 = 0.00083
normalized_image = [dim * scale_factor for dim in original_image]
# Result preserves aspect ratio but fits standard size
```

## Check if Your Vectors Are Normalized

```python
def check_if_normalized(vector, tolerance=1e-6):
    """Check if vector is normalized (length ≈ 1)"""
    length = np.linalg.norm(vector)
    return abs(length - 1.0) < tolerance

# Test your vectors
bank_money = [1.2, 0.6, 0.8, 0.3]
print(f"Is normalized? {check_if_normalized(bank_money)}")  # False

# OpenAI embeddings (these ARE normalized)
openai_embedding = [0.123, -0.456, 0.789, ...]  # length = 1.0
print(f"Is normalized? {check_if_normalized(openai_embedding)}")  # True
```

## For Your Word Vectors: Use Cosine Distance

Since your vectors like `[1.2, 0.6, ...]` are **not normalized** (length > 1), you should use **cosine distance** (`<=>`):

```sql
-- For your word vectors
SELECT * FROM words 
ORDER BY embedding <=> '[1.2,0.6,0.8,0.3]' 
LIMIT 5;
```

**Why cosine is better for your case:**

```python
# Example with word vectors of different "strengths"
bank_money = [1.2, 0.6, 0.8]      # Strong associations
bank_river = [0.3, 0.1, 0.2]      # Weak associations  
query = [0.6, 0.3, 0.4]           # Medium strength

# Inner product favors stronger vectors
inner_bank_money = np.dot(query, bank_money)  # 1.28
inner_bank_river = np.dot(query, bank_river)  # 0.26

# Cosine focuses on direction/meaning, not strength
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
cos_bank_money = cosine_similarity([query], [bank_money])[0][0]  # ~1.0
cos_bank_river = cosine_similarity([query], [bank_river])[0][0]  # ~1.0

print("Inner product makes 'bank-money' seem much more relevant")
print("Cosine shows they're equally relevant conceptually")
```

## Complete Example for Your Use Case

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

class WordVectorStore:
    def __init__(self):
        # Your word->vector mappings
        self.word_vectors = {
            "bank-money": [1.2, 0.6, 0.8, 0.3],
            "bank-river": [0.3, 0.1, 0.2, 0.9],
            "finance-loan": [1.1, 0.7, 0.9, 0.2],
            "water-flow": [0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.8]
        }
    
    def find_similar_words(self, query_vector, top_k=3):
        """Find most similar words using cosine similarity"""
        similarities = []
        
        for word, vector in self.word_vectors.items():
            # Use cosine similarity for non-normalized vectors
            sim = cosine_similarity([query_vector], [vector])[0][0]
            similarities.append((word, sim, vector))
        
        # Sort by similarity (higher = more similar)
        similarities.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        return similarities[:top_k]
    
    def normalize_vector(self, vector):
        """Convert to unit vector if you want to use inner product later"""
        return vector / np.linalg.norm(vector)

# Usage
store = WordVectorStore()
query = [0.8, 0.4, 0.6, 0.3]  # Your query vector

# Find similar words
results = store.find_similar_words(query)
for word, similarity, vector in results:
    print(f"{word}: {similarity:.3f} similarity")
    print(f"  Vector: {vector}")
```

## PostgreSQL Setup for Your Vectors

```sql
-- Create table for your word vectors
CREATE TABLE word_embeddings (
    word TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    embedding vector(4),  -- Adjust dimension to match your vectors
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Insert your word vectors
INSERT INTO word_embeddings (word, embedding) VALUES 
('bank-money', '[1.2,0.6,0.8,0.3]'),
('bank-river', '[0.3,0.1,0.2,0.9]'),
('finance-loan', '[1.1,0.7,0.9,0.2]');

-- Create index for cosine similarity (best for your non-normalized vectors)
CREATE INDEX ON word_embeddings 
USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);

-- Query for similar words
SELECT word, (embedding <=> '[0.8,0.4,0.6,0.3]') as distance
FROM word_embeddings 
ORDER BY embedding <=> '[0.8,0.4,0.6,0.3]' 
LIMIT 5;
```

## Summary for Your Case

**Your vectors `[1.2, 0.6, ...]`**:
- ❌ **Not normalized** (length ≠ 1)
- ✅ **Use cosine distance** (`<=>` in pgvector)
- ✅ **More fair comparison** across different vector magnitudes

**If you had OpenAI embeddings**:
- ✅ **Pre-normalized** (length = 1)  
- ✅ **Use inner product** (`<#>` in pgvector)
- ✅ **Faster computation** since normalization already done

The key insight: cosine similarity is like comparing the "direction" of meaning regardless of how "loud" or "strong" the signal is, while inner product includes that strength in the comparison.
