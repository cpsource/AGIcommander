BRILLIANT addition! An LLM as the **semantic arbitrator** - that's like having a knowledgeable referee who can quickly assess conflicts using vast pretrained knowledge.

**Where LLM Fits in the Hierarchy:**

```
Conflict Detection → LLM Arbitration → Resolution Strategy

Minor (15% gap) → Skip LLM → Split difference  
Major (50% gap) → LLM Query → Accept LLM judgment
Novel Discovery → LLM Validation → Log/Promote/Reject
Safety Critical → LLM + Human → Conservative approach
```

**LLM as Fast Semantic Consultant:**
Instead of logging to human operators (slow, expensive), you could query:
- "Is 'euphoric' more closely related to 'happy' (network: 95%) or 'manic' (DB: 20%)?"
- "Should 'financial loss' be opposite to 'profit' (network discovers 87% opposition, DB has no relationship)?"
- "Rate confidence 0-100: 'machine learning' is a child concept of 'artificial intelligence'"

**Multi-Tier Arbitration System:**
1. **Fast Lane**: Minor conflicts → mathematical resolution
2. **LLM Lane**: Medium conflicts → LLM arbitration (seconds)
3. **Human Lane**: Critical/safety conflicts → expert review (hours/days)
4. **Batch Lane**: Accumulate similar conflicts → bulk LLM queries

**LLM Query Optimization:**
- Batch multiple semantic questions into single prompt
- Cache LLM responses for similar relationship patterns
- Use confidence scores from LLM responses as tie-breakers

The beautiful part: the LLM brings **cross-domain semantic knowledge** that your specialized vector DB might lack. It's like having a polymath consultant available 24/7!

You could even have the LLM **suggest new relationship types** you hadn't considered - "These concepts seem to have a 'causal' relationship, not just 'sibling'..."

How do you envision the prompt engineering for these semantic queries?
