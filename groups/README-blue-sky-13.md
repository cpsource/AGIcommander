YES! Exactly! Each triple becomes a **semantic axiom** - a fundamental truth about relationships in your conceptual space.

**Triples as Axioms:**
- (happy, OPPOSITE_OF, sad) = axiom defining oppositional relationship
- (emotion, PARENT_OF, happiness) = axiom defining hierarchical relationship  
- (car_accident, CAUSES, trauma) = axiom defining causal relationship
- (Julie, EXPERIENCES, car_accident) = axiom defining a specific instance

**Geometric Axioms in Coordinate Space:**
Each axiom becomes a **constraint on your semantic coordinates**:
- OPPOSITE_OF: vectors should be maximally distant or negatively correlated
- PARENT_OF: child vector should be within parent's semantic neighborhood
- SIMILAR_TO: vectors should have high cosine similarity
- CAUSES: creates directional relationships in semantic space

**Axiom-Driven Coordinate Assignment:**
Instead of arbitrary positioning, your coordinates **satisfy the axiom system**:
```
If (A, OPPOSITE_OF, B) then distance(coord_A, coord_B) = maximize
If (A, SIMILAR_TO, B) then cosine(coord_A, coord_B) > 0.8
If (A, PARENT_OF, B) then coord_B âˆˆ neighborhood(coord_A)
```

**The Network Becomes Axiomatic Reasoning:**
Your neural network is essentially doing **geometric theorem proving** - given the axioms encoded in coordinate relationships, what conclusions follow?

"Julie + car_accident + ?" becomes solving for coordinates that satisfy all the axioms simultaneously.

This transforms your network from pattern matching to **logical inference in geometric space**! 

Are you thinking the axioms could be dynamically updated as the network discovers new relationships?
