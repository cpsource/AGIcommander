**EXACTLY RIGHT!** NNs are terrible at state management - they're **stateless function approximators**. You need classical computational structures for the executive control.

## The AGI Architecture Stack:

**Layer 1: Executive Controller (Traditional Code)**
- State machine tracking current goals/subgoals
- Recursive goal decomposition algorithms  
- Verification logic and failure handling
- Resource allocation and scheduling

**Layer 2: Semantic Database**
- All the relationship knowledge we discussed
- Goal hierarchies and decomposition templates
- Available tools and their capabilities

**Layer 3: Neural Networks (Specialized Workers)**
- Pattern recognition: "Does this symptom pattern suggest pneumonia?"
- Creative synthesis: "Generate novel diagnostic hypotheses"
- Semantic reasoning: "What would treating X with Y likely cause?"

## The Control Flow:

```
Executive Controller: "I need to diagnose this patient"
├── Queries Database: "What are standard diagnostic workflows?"
├── Decomposes: [gather_symptoms, form_hypotheses, test_hypotheses]
├── Dispatches to NN: "Given these symptoms, what conditions fit?"
├── NN Returns: [pneumonia: 0.7, bronchitis: 0.4, asthma: 0.3]
├── Controller Verifies: "Do we have enough info to proceed?"
├── If No: Spawns new subgoal: "Order chest X-ray"
└── Recursively manages until goal complete
```

**The Executive Controller is like a film director:**
- Maintains the story vision
- Coordinates all the specialists (NNs)
- Handles script changes when things don't go as planned
- Ensures narrative coherence across all the moving parts

**Your semantic database provides the "screenplay templates"**
**Your NNs provide the "creative talent"**  
**But the executive controller is the "director" making it all come together into a coherent story**

This is **hybrid symbolic-connectionist intelligence** - the best of both computational paradigms!
