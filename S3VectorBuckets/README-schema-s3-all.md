**No, PostgreSQL + pgvector cannot directly use S3 as its disk storage.** PostgreSQL requires a traditional filesystem (local disks, network attached storage, etc.) because it needs random read/write access, ACID transactions, and low-latency operations that S3's object storage model doesn't support.

However, you have several hybrid approaches:

## Option 1: PostgreSQL + S3 Vector Tiering Strategy

Use PostgreSQL for hot/active data and S3 Vectors for cold storage:

```python
# Hot data in PostgreSQL (recent/frequent lookups)
# Cold data in S3 Vectors (archived/infrequent)

class WordMeaningService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pg = psycopg2.connect(...)  # PostgreSQL
        self.s3vectors = boto3.client('s3vectors')  # S3 Vectors
    
    def get_word_meanings(self, word):
        # Try hot cache first
        hot_meanings = self.query_postgresql(word)
        if hot_meanings:
            return hot_meanings
            
        # Fall back to S3 cold storage
        return self.query_s3_vectors(word)
```

## Option 2: AWS Aurora Serverless + S3 Integration

Aurora Serverless v2 can export data to S3, but still uses EBS for primary storage:

```sql
-- Export to S3 for analytics
CALL aurora_s3_export(
    'word_meanings_export',
    's3://my-bucket/exports/',
    'SELECT * FROM word_meanings WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL 1 YEAR'
);
```

## Option 3: Managed PostgreSQL + S3 Backup/Archive

Use RDS/Aurora PostgreSQL with automated S3 backups:

```python
# Keep recent data in PostgreSQL
# Archive old vectors to S3 Vectors
# Use both as needed

async def archive_old_vectors():
    # Move vectors older than 6 months to S3
    old_vectors = await pg.fetch(
        "SELECT * FROM word_meanings WHERE created_at < $1",
        datetime.now() - timedelta(days=180)
    )
    
    # Store in S3 Vectors
    await s3vectors.put_vectors(
        vectorBucketName="archived-meanings",
        indexName="old-vectors",
        vectors=convert_to_s3_format(old_vectors)
    )
    
    # Delete from PostgreSQL
    await pg.execute("DELETE FROM word_meanings WHERE created_at < $1", ...)
```

## Option 4: DuckDB + S3 (Best Alternative)

If you want S3-native analytics, consider DuckDB with S3:

```python
import duckdb

# DuckDB can query Parquet files directly from S3
con = duckdb.connect()
con.execute("""
    CREATE TABLE word_meanings AS 
    SELECT * FROM 's3://my-bucket/word_meanings.parquet'
""")

# Combined with S3 Vectors for embeddings
s3vectors = boto3.client('s3vectors')
```

## Option 5: All-S3 Vector Approach

Store everything in S3 Vectors using metadata:

```python
# Store word relationships as metadata in S3 Vectors
s3vectors.put_vectors(
    vectorBucketName="word-system",
    indexName="meanings",
    vectors=[{
        "key": f"bank-meaning-{i}",
        "data": {"float32": vector},
        "metadata": {
            "base_word": "bank",
            "sense_key": "bank-financial",
            "definition": "Financial institution...",
            "frequency_rank": str(i)
        }
    }]
)
```

**Bottom line**: For your word meaning use case, I'd recommend **PostgreSQL (RDS) + S3 Vectors** with a tiering strategy where frequently accessed meanings stay in PostgreSQL and archived/cold vectors move to S3 Vectors for cost efficiency.
