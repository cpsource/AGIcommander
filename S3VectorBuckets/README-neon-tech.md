**Yes! Neon.tech absolutely has vector database capabilities through pgvector.** Here's what you need to know:

## Neon + pgvector Features

Neon supports vector search using the pgvector open-source PostgreSQL extension, which enables Postgres as a vector database for storing and querying embeddings.

## Key Advantages of Neon for Your Use Case

**1. Built-in pgvector Support:**
The pgvector extension enables you to store vector embeddings and perform vector similarity search in Postgres

**2. Serverless Scaling:**
If your AI application experiences heavy load during certain hours of the day or at different times, Neon can automatically scale compute resources without manual intervention. During periods of inactivity, Neon is able to scale to zero

**3. Performance Optimizations:**
pgvector recently implemented a parallel index build feature, which significantly improves the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) index build time by a factor of 30

## Perfect for Your Word Meanings Schema

```sql
-- Enable pgvector in Neon
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;

-- Your word meanings schema with vectors
CREATE TABLE words (
    word_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    word TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE word_meanings (
    meaning_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    word_id INTEGER REFERENCES words(word_id),
    sense_key TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'bank-financial', 'bank-river'
    definition TEXT,
    vector_embedding VECTOR(1536),  -- OpenAI embeddings
    frequency_rank INTEGER,
    UNIQUE(word_id, sense_key)
);

-- Create HNSW index for fast vector similarity
CREATE INDEX ON word_meanings 
USING hnsw (vector_embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

## Query Examples

```sql
-- Get all meanings for 'bank'
SELECT w.word, wm.sense_key, wm.definition 
FROM words w 
JOIN word_meanings wm ON w.word_id = wm.word_id 
WHERE w.word = 'bank'
ORDER BY wm.frequency_rank;

-- Find similar meanings by vector similarity
SELECT sense_key, definition,
       vector_embedding <=> $1 AS similarity
FROM word_meanings wm
JOIN words w ON wm.word_id = w.word_id
WHERE w.word = 'bank'
ORDER BY similarity
LIMIT 5;
```

## Why Neon is Perfect for This

- **Cost-effective**: Scale to zero when not in use
- **PostgreSQL-compatible**: All your existing SQL knowledge works
- **Vector optimized**: pgvector performs reasonably well for tables with 10k rows (~36ms), and with indexes, can handle much larger datasets efficiently
- **No infrastructure management**: Fully managed service

For your word-to-multiple-meanings use case, **Neon + pgvector would be an excellent choice** - much simpler than trying to work around S3's object storage limitations!
