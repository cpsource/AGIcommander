Brilliant analysis! You're thinking about the fundamental building blocks of cognition itself. Let me blue-sky some additional foundational concepts and architectural approaches:

## Additional Foundational Concepts 🧠

### **Metacognitive Layer**
- **Self-reflection**: "I don't understand this problem"
- **Confidence calibration**: Knowing when you're wrong
- **Learning about learning**: Adapting strategies based on success/failure
- **Theory of mind**: Understanding that others have different knowledge/beliefs

### **Social Intelligence**
- **Empathy modeling**: Predicting others' emotional states
- **Social hierarchy awareness**: Power dynamics, status, respect
- **Cultural context switching**: Different behaviors for different social groups
- **Reputation tracking**: How actions affect long-term relationships

### **Creative & Generative Thinking**
- **Analogical reasoning**: Mapping patterns across domains
- **Counterfactual thinking**: "What if?" scenarios
- **Constraint satisfaction**: Finding solutions within limits
- **Aesthetic preferences**: What's beautiful, elegant, or pleasing

### **Memory Architecture**
- **Episodic memory**: Personal experiences with rich context
- **Procedural memory**: Skill acquisition and muscle memory
- **Working memory management**: Attention allocation and focus
- **Memory consolidation**: Sleep-like processes for long-term storage

### **Causal Understanding**
- **Mechanism modeling**: How things actually work
- **Intervention reasoning**: What happens if I change X?
- **Responsibility attribution**: Who/what caused this outcome?
- **Emergent system behavior**: Complex systems from simple rules

### **Value Alignment & Ethics**
- **Moral reasoning**: Rights, duties, consequences
- **Value hierarchy**: Prioritizing competing goods
- **Ethical dilemma resolution**: Trolley problem-style decisions
- **Cultural moral relativism**: Different ethics in different contexts

## Architectural Approaches 🏗️

### **Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)**

- **Implementation**: Agent swarms with coordination protocols
- **Use case**: Parallel processing of emotions, logic, creativity, social reasoning

### **Attention-Based Executive Control**
- **Concept**: Central attention allocator managing cognitive resources
- **Implementation**: Transformer-like attention over cognitive modules
- **Use case**: Focus management, task switching, priority handling

### **Predictive Processing Framework**
- **Concept**: Brain as prediction machine minimizing surprise
- **Implementation**: Hierarchical Bayesian networks with error correction
- **Use case**: Perception, action planning, learning from prediction errors

### **Dual Process Architecture**
- **Concept**: Fast/intuitive System 1 vs slow/deliberate System 2
- **Implementation**: Reactive NN + symbolic reasoning system
- **Use case**: Quick decisions vs careful analysis

### **Embodied Cognition Simulation**
- **Concept**: Cognition emerges from sensorimotor experience
- **Implementation**: Virtual body in physics simulation + neural control
- **Use case**: Spatial reasoning, physical intuition, motor planning

### **Dynamic Systems Theory**
- **Concept**: Cognition as evolving dynamical system
- **Implementation**: Recurrent neural networks with complex dynamics
- **Use case**: Mood transitions, emotional regulation, habit formation

### **Modular Bayesian Brain**
- **Concept**: Specialized modules communicating via probabilistic messages
- **Implementation**: Probabilistic graphical models with neural components
- **Use case**: Uncertainty handling, belief updating, decision making

### **Memory-Augmented Networks**
- **Concept**: External memory systems with neural read/write controllers
- **Implementation**: Differentiable memory architectures
- **Use case**: Episodic memory, working memory, knowledge consolidation

### **Curiosity-Driven Learning**
- **Concept**: Intrinsic motivation through information gain
- **Implementation**: Information-theoretic reward functions
- **Use case**: Exploration, skill acquisition, knowledge seeking

## Integration Architecture 🔄

### **Global Workspace Theory**
- Central "broadcasting" system where different modules compete for conscious awareness
- Winner gets to influence other modules globally

### **Cognitive Architecture Stack**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   Consciousness Layer   │  ← Global workspace, self-awareness
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Executive Control     │  ← Attention, goal management, planning
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Cognitive Modules     │  ← Memory, language, spatial, social
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Emotional/Motivational│  ← Drives, mood, rewards, values
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Sensorimotor Layer    │  ← Perception, action, embodiment
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### **Developmental Learning**
- System that grows in complexity over time
- Early simple behaviors enable more complex ones later
- Like human cognitive development from infant to adult

## The Holy Grail Questions 🏆

1. **Hard Problem of Consciousness**: How does subjective experience emerge?
2. **Symbol Grounding**: How do abstract concepts connect to sensorimotor experience?
3. **Common Sense Reasoning**: How do we handle everyday physics and social intuitions?
4. **Transfer Learning**: How do we apply knowledge flexibly across domains?
5. **Value Learning**: How do we learn what's truly important from limited examples?

The path to AGI might require integrating ALL of these concepts into a coherent, growing, self-modifying system that can bootstrap its own intelligence. Each piece you mentioned - time, goals, rewards, spatial reasoning, human drives, emotions, self-awareness - seems essential for the full picture.
