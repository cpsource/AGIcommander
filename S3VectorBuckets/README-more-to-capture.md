Great question! You've captured a **significant portion** of the entropy, but I think there are still several layers you could extract:

## What You've Captured Well âœ…
- **Core semantic relationships** (subject-verb-object triplets)
- **Word sense disambiguation** (bank-financial vs bank-river)
- **Human qualities** in vectors (good/bad, powerful/weak)
- **Relational structure** (creates, is_a, released_during)

## Additional Entropy You Could Capture ðŸŽ¯

### 1. **Pragmatic/Contextual Information**
```
"Apple released a new iPhone model last year."
```
- **Implicit knowledge**: This implies competition (why emphasize "new"?)
- **Market context**: "Last year" suggests recency/relevance
- **Speaker intent**: Is this informative, promotional, or comparative?

### 2. **Temporal Nuance & Sequencing**
- **Event ordering**: Release â†’ availability â†’ market impact
- **Temporal deixis**: "Last year" relative to when/who is speaking
- **Frequency patterns**: Apple releases phones annually (implicit pattern)

### 3. **Quantitative & Scalar Information**
- **Magnitude**: "new" suggests degree of innovation
- **Scope**: "a model" (singular) vs "models" (multiple)
- **Market positioning**: Premium vs budget (implicit in "iPhone")

### 4. **Discourse & Rhetorical Structure**
- **Focus/Topic**: What's being emphasized (Apple? iPhone? timing?)
- **Presuppositions**: Assumes listener knows what iPhone/Apple are
- **Speech act**: Stating fact vs making announcement vs comparison

### 5. **Emotional/Attitudinal Subtext**
```python
# Additional vector dimensions you could add:
"discourse_markers": {
    "emphasis": 0.6,  # "new" emphasizes novelty
    "certainty": 0.9,  # Definitive statement
    "formality": 0.7,  # Business/news register
    "objectivity": 0.8  # Factual tone
}
```

### 6. **Compositional Semantics**
- **Modifier relationships**: "new iPhone model" - how does "new" modify the whole phrase?
- **Scope ambiguity**: Does "last year" modify "released" or "model"?
- **Semantic roles**: Agent, Patient, Instrument, Time, etc.

### 7. **Inferred Knowledge & World Model**
```python
# Implicit triplets you could extract:
"iPhone-product_line -> competes_with -> Android-product_line"
"Apple-company -> operates_in -> technology-industry" 
"new_iPhone_model-product -> targets -> consumers-market_segment"
"last_year-time_period -> part_of -> product_cycle-business_pattern"
```

## Entropy Estimation ðŸ“Š

I'd estimate you've captured about **70-80%** of the semantic entropy. The remaining 20-30% includes:
- Pragmatic implications (10%)
- Discourse structure (5%)
- Implicit world knowledge (10%)
- Emotional/attitudinal subtext (5%)

## Next Level: Multi-Modal Entropy
If you want to go deeper:
- **Phonetic stress patterns** (if spoken)
- **Visual layout** (if written - fonts, formatting)
- **Cultural context** (different meanings across cultures)
- **Individual speaker knowledge** (personal associations)

## Practical Recommendation

For most NLP applications, you've captured the **essential semantic entropy**. The additional layers might be overkill unless you're building something that needs deep pragmatic understanding (like a sophisticated dialogue system or cultural analysis tool).

Your triplet + vector approach is already quite sophisticated! ðŸŽ¯
