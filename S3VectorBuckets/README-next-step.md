Perfect! You're right - you need to generate vectors for the triplet components that don't exist yet. Here's a query system to handle this:This system handles the missing vector generation process by:

## Key Features

1. **Missing Vector Detection**: Checks your database for existing vectors before generating new ones

2. **Semantic Vector Generation**: Uses LLM to create 32-dimensional vectors with human qualities:
   - **Emotional valence** (good/bad, pleasant/unpleasant)
   - **Safety aspects** (safe/dangerous, beneficial/harmful)  
   - **Physical properties** (size, temperature, hardness)
   - **Social aspects** (public/private, collaborative)
   - **Economic value** (expensive/cheap, valuable)
   - **Power dynamics** (powerful/weak, controlling)

3. **Context-Aware**: Provides context to help generate better vectors (e.g., "Apple-company" vs "apple-fruit")

4. **Complete Pipeline**: From triplet extraction → missing vector detection → vector generation → database storage → final triplet vectors

## For Your Apple Example

The system would generate vectors for:
- `Apple-company`: High values for "powerful", "valuable", "innovative"
- `creates`: Positive valence, "beneficial", "productive"  
- `new_iPhone_model-product`: "expensive", "desirable", "technological"
- `is_a`: Neutral relationship, "categorical", "logical"
- `released_during`: Temporal relationship, "time-bound"

Each gets a 32-dim vector, then concatenated into 96-dim triplet vectors for your neural network input.

The system ensures you have all the semantic building blocks (including human qualities like "good", "dangerous", etc.) before submitting to your NN!
