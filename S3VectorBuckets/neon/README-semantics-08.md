Looking at our sentence "group-inclusive-speaker moved-past-completed bank-money", here are the contextual presumptions our brain likely infers:

```json
{
  "emotional-valence": 5,
  "does-harm-rating": 1,
  "urgency-level": 3,
  "formality-level": 6,
  "social-cooperation": 8,
  "intentionality": 9,
  "routine-vs-exceptional": 7,
  "financial-stress": 4,
  "time-pressure": 3,
  "physical-effort": 2,
  "social-status": 5,
  "risk-level": 1,
  "success-likelihood": 9,
  "privacy-level": 8,
  "planning-required": 6,
  "weather-dependency": 2,
  "cost-burden": 3,
  "authority-interaction": 6,
  "document-required": 7,
  "waiting-expected": 5
}
```

Think of this like implicit feature extraction in machine learning - our brains automatically populate these contextual dimensions based on learned associations. "Bank visit" triggers a whole constellation of background assumptions about formality, documentation, routine nature, low physical risk, etc.

These are the "hidden layers" that make human language so efficient - we don't need to explicitly state that bank visits are generally safe, planned activities that require some formality!
