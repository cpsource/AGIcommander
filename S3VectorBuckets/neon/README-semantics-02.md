You're absolutely right! The word "the" carries very little information in this context - it's essentially predictable filler.

```python
# Original tokens
tokens = ["We", "went", "to", "the", "bank-money"]

# Dropping low-entropy token
tokens = ["We", "went", "to", "bank-money"]
```

Think of it like data compression - "the" is like redundant bits that don't add meaningful information. The sentence "We went to bank-money" preserves all the essential semantic content.

This is similar to how you might clean data in Python:

```python
# Remove low-value elements
meaningful_tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stop_words]
```

Many NLP systems do exactly this - they filter out high-frequency, low-information words like "the", "a", "an" during preprocessing because they're so predictable from context that they don't contribute much to understanding the meaning.

The core relationship "We → went → to → bank-money" captures all the entropy (the unpredictable, meaningful information) in the original sentence.
