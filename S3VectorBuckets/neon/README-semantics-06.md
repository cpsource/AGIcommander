Excellent! Let's analyze "went" semantically:

"Went" encodes:
- **past tense** (not present/future)
- **completed action** (not ongoing)
- **physical movement** (not abstract change)
- **from one location to another** (directional)

```python
# Semantic token for past completed physical movement
semantic_token = "moved-past-completed"

# Our ultra-compressed sentence
tokens = ["group-inclusive-speaker", "moved-past-completed", "bank-money"]
```

This is like creating another semantic class:
```python
class MovedPastCompleted:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tense = "past"
        self.aspect = "completed" 
        self.type = "physical_movement"
        self.direction = "to_destination"
```

Now we have:
**"group-inclusive-speaker moved-past-completed bank-money"**

Each token is a pure semantic primitive - no redundancy, maximum information density. It's like we've created our own semantic assembly language where each instruction does exactly one conceptual thing!

This could replace "went", "traveled", "walked", "drove", "headed", "proceeded" - any past-tense completed movement verb.
