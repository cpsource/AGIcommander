Looking at your semantic sentence processing problem, I'd recommend a **hybrid iterative approach** with SQL + Vector DB backing. Here's my reasoning:

## Why Iterative Makes Sense

Your semantic inheritance system is naturally iterative - you're building understanding layer by layer:
1. **Tokenization** → basic lexical units
2. **Disambiguation** → context-specific meanings  
3. **Hypernym resolution** → inherited properties
4. **Context inference** → environmental assumptions

This maps perfectly to partial entropy → full entropy progression.

## Recommended Architecture

```python
class IterativeSemanticProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sql_db = SQLHypernymsDB()          # Fast hierarchical lookups
        self.vector_db = VectorContextDB()       # Semantic similarity
        self.context_nn = ContextInferenceNN()   # Trained on context patterns
    
    def process_iteratively(self, sentence, max_iterations=5):
        state = {"tokens": [], "entropy": 0.0, "context": {}}
        
        for iteration in range(max_iterations):
            # Each iteration adds entropy
            state = self.iteration_step(state, sentence)
            
            if state["entropy"] >= CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD:
                break
                
        return state
    
    def iteration_step(self, current_state, sentence):
        # SQL: Fast hypernym chain lookups
        hypernyms = self.sql_db.get_inheritance_chain(current_state["tokens"])
        
        # Vector: Find similar semantic contexts
        similar_contexts = self.vector_db.find_similar(sentence, current_state)
        
        # NN: Predict missing context dimensions
        predicted_context = self.context_nn.predict(current_state, similar_contexts)
        
        # Merge and return updated state
        return self.merge_entropy(current_state, hypernyms, predicted_context)
```

## Why This Beats Pure Neural/Tree Approaches

**vs Pure Neural Network:**
- **Explainable**: You can trace exactly why "bank" → "financial-institution"
- **Incremental**: Can stop early if confidence is high
- **Efficient**: Don't need to retrain for new hypernym relationships

**vs Pure If/Then/Else Trees:**
- **Handles ambiguity**: Vector similarity handles cases your rules miss
- **Learns patterns**: NN picks up context correlations you didn't program
- **Scalable**: Adding new semantic tokens doesn't explode your rule tree

## Database Strategy

```sql
-- SQL for fast hierarchy traversal
CREATE TABLE hypernym_chains (
    child_concept VARCHAR(100),
    parent_concept VARCHAR(100), 
    inheritance_level INT,
    semantic_bits JSON
);

-- Vector DB for context similarity
-- Store: sentence_embedding, context_json, frequency
```

## Training the Context NN

Train on triplets: `(partial_semantic_state, similar_contexts, final_context_json)`

```python
# Training data format
training_data = [
    {
        "input": {"tokens": ["group-inclusive-speaker"], "partial_context": {...}},
        "similar_contexts": [...],  # from vector search
        "target": {"formality_level": 6.0, "social_cooperation": 8.0, ...}
    }
]
```

## Key Advantages

1. **Partial Processing**: Can return useful results even if interrupted
2. **Confidence Scaling**: More iterations = higher confidence, but diminishing returns
3. **Hybrid Strengths**: SQL speed + Vector similarity + NN pattern recognition
4. **Debuggable**: Each iteration shows what entropy was added

The iterative approach fits your semantic inheritance model perfectly - you're literally building understanding step by step, just like human comprehension!
