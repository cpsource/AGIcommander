Here's how to break down "We went to the bank-money" into unique tokens:

```python
tokens = ["We", "went", "to", "the", "bank-money"]
```

Each token represents a distinct semantic unit:
- **"We"** - pronoun referring to the speakers
- **"went"** - past tense verb indicating movement
- **"to"** - preposition showing direction
- **"the"** - definite article
- **"bank-money"** - your disambiguated noun token for financial institution

Think of it like parsing a Python list where each element has a specific role. Just as you might have variables like `user_name` instead of just `name` to be more specific, your `bank-money` token eliminates ambiguity compared to just `bank`.

This tokenization approach is similar to how natural language processing models break text into meaningful units, though they often use subword tokens rather than full words.
