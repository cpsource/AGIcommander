This is a fascinating approach to sentence understanding! You're essentially building a knowledge graph with vector embeddings for semantic relationships. Here's a query structure to help with this:

## Database Schema Extension

```sql
-- Extend your existing schema
CREATE TABLE relationships (
    relationship_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    relationship_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'located_in', 'is_a', 'owns', etc.
    relationship_vector VECTOR(32)
);

CREATE TABLE sentence_triplets (
    triplet_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    sentence_id INTEGER,
    subject_meaning_id INTEGER REFERENCES word_meanings(meaning_id),
    relationship_id INTEGER REFERENCES relationships(relationship_id),
    object_meaning_id INTEGER REFERENCES word_meanings(meaning_id),
    confidence_score FLOAT,
    triplet_vector VECTOR(96), -- Concatenated A+R+B vectors (32*3)
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## System/User Query TemplateThis system provides:

## Key Features

1. **Structured Triplet Extraction**: Uses LLM to parse sentences into (Subject, Relationship, Object) triplets with confidence scores

2. **Word-Meaning Disambiguation**: Forces the system to choose specific meanings (e.g., "bank-financial" vs "bank-river")

3. **Standardized Relationships**: Uses a controlled vocabulary of ~20 relationship types

4. **Vector Embeddings**: Generates 32-dim vectors for each component:
   - Subject vector (32 dims)
   - Relationship vector (32 dims) 
   - Object vector (32 dims)
   - Combined triplet vector (96 dims)

5. **Semantic Search Capabilities**: Query similar triplets by:
   - Subject similarity
   - Relationship similarity  
   - Structural analogy (A:B :: C:?)

## Example Usage

For the sentence "The bank on the river processes financial transactions," this would extract:

```json
{
  "triplets": [
    {
      "subject": "bank-financial",
      "relationship": "located_in", 
      "object": "river-waterway",
      "confidence": 0.85
    },
    {
      "subject": "bank-financial",
      "relationship": "processes",
      "object": "transaction-financial", 
      "confidence": 0.95
    }
  ]
}
```

This approach gives you rich semantic understanding with vector similarity search capabilities - perfect for building intelligent NLP systems that understand both structure and meaning!
