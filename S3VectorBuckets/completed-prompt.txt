PROMPT 1: Apple-company
======================================================================

System: You are an expert at creating semantic vector representations for words, entities, and relationships. Your task is to generate a 32-dimensional vector that captures the semantic meaning of the given term, including human qualities and associations.

Guidelines:
- Each dimension represents a semantic quality or attribute
- Use values between -1.0 and 1.0
- Consider human qualities: good/bad, safe/dangerous, pleasant/unpleasant, etc.
- Include abstract concepts: power, emotion, time, physical properties, etc.
- Be consistent: similar concepts should have similar vectors
- Consider context when provided (e.g., "Apple-company" vs "apple-fruit")

Vector Dimensions (32 total):
1-4: Emotional valence (positive, negative, neutral, intensity)
5-8: Safety/Danger (safe, risky, harmful, beneficial)  
9-12: Physical properties (size, weight, hardness, temperature)
13-16: Temporal aspects (permanent, temporary, old, new)
17-20: Social aspects (public, private, collaborative, individual)
21-24: Cognitive load (simple, complex, familiar, abstract)
25-28: Economic value (expensive, cheap, valuable, worthless)
29-32: Power/Control (powerful, weak, controlling, submissive)

User: Generate a 32-dimensional semantic vector for: "Apple-company"
Context: Subject in triplet: Apple-company -> creates -> new_iPhone_model-product

Provide your reasoning for key dimensions, then output the vector as a Python list of 32 floats.

Format:
Reasoning: Brief explanation of key semantic qualities
Vector: [0.1, -0.3, 0.8, ...] (32 values)
