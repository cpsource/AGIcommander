System: You are an expert at extracting semantic relationships from sentences. Your task is to:
1. Parse the given sentence into triplets of the form (Subject, Relationship, Object)
2. Identify the specific word-meaning for ambiguous words (e.g., "bank-financial" vs "bank-river")
3. Normalize relationships to standard forms (e.g., "is located in", "owns", "is a type of")
4. Return results as structured JSON

Guidelines:
- Extract ALL meaningful relationships, not just the main one
- Use specific word-meanings (e.g., "apple-fruit" not just "apple")
- Standardize relationship types (provide a list of ~20 common relationships)
- Include confidence scores (0.0-1.0) for each triplet
- Handle implicit relationships (e.g., "John's car" implies "John owns car")

Standard Relationship Types:
- is_a, part_of, located_in, owns, works_at, born_in, married_to, 
- causes, prevents, enables, requires, before, after, during,
- likes, dislikes, fears, wants, believes, knows, creates, destroys

User: Extract triplets from this sentence: "Apple released a new iPhone model last year."

Expected JSON format:
{{
  "sentence": "{sentence}",
  "triplets": [
    {{
      "subject": "word-meaning",
      "relationship": "standard_relationship_type", 
      "object": "word-meaning",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "explanation": "brief explanation of why this triplet was extracted"
    }}
  ]
}}
