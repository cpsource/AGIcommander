Absolutely! Here's the modified prompt that will produce JSON output with explanations for each vector dimension:Perfect! Now the prompt will generate structured JSON output that gives you:

## JSON Structure

1. **Basic Info**: Term, context, and overall reasoning
2. **Vector Array**: The 32 float values  
3. **Detailed Dimensions**: Each of the 32 dimensions with:
   - **Index**: Position in the vector (0-31)
   - **Value**: The actual float value
   - **Explanation**: Why that specific value was chosen

## Benefits for Testing

- **Interpretability**: You can see exactly what each dimension represents
- **Debugging**: Easy to spot if the LLM misunderstood something
- **Consistency**: Compare similar terms to ensure logical relationships
- **Validation**: Verify the reasoning matches your expectations

## Example Usage

Using your Apple-company vector, you'd get JSON showing:
- Index 0 (positive): 0.8 - "Strong brand perception"  
- Index 24 (expensive): 1.0 - "Premium pricing strategy"
- Index 28 (powerful): 1.0 - "Immense market influence"

This makes it much easier to validate that your vectors capture the semantic qualities you want, including those human aspects like "good/bad" and "powerful/weak" that are crucial for your knowledge graph system!
