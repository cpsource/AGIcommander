Based on the file structure in your AGIcommander project and following the pattern you established with the S3 server, this file should be called:

**`vector_db_mcp_server.py`**

And it should be placed in the directory:
```
servers/memory/vector_db/vector_db_mcp_server.py
```

This follows your established naming convention:
- **S3 server**: `servers/memory/S3/s3_mcp_server.py`
- **Vector DB server**: `servers/memory/vector_db/vector_db_mcp_server.py`

The naming pattern is consistent:
- `{technology}_{purpose}_server.py` format
- Matches the directory name (`vector_db`)
- Aligns with your pyproject.toml entry points:
  - Script: `vector-db-mcp-server = "servers.memory.vector_db.vector_db_mcp_server:main"`
  - Plugin: `vector_db_server = "servers.memory.vector_db.vector_db_mcp_server:VectorDBMCPServer"`

So create this directory structure:
```
servers/
└── memory/
    ├── S3/
    │   └── s3_mcp_server.py
    └── vector_db/
        ├── vector_db_mcp_server.py
        └── README.md
```

This keeps your memory servers organized and makes it easy to add more memory backends in the future (like Redis, PostgreSQL with pgvector, etc.).
