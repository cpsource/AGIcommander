I'll create a vector database MCP server for AGIcommander! Think of this as building the **brain's memory system** - where your AI can store, search, and retrieve knowledge using semantic similarity rather than just exact matches.Now let me create the supporting files and update your main pyproject.toml to include the vector database server:Now let me update your main pyproject.toml to include the vector database integration:Perfect! I've created a comprehensive Vector Database MCP server for AGIcommander. Here's what this brings to your AI system:

## The Memory System Analogy

Think of your AGIcommander now having **two types of memory**:

- **Vector Database** = **Semantic Long-term Memory** (understands meaning and relationships)
- **S3 Storage** = **Archival Storage** (persistent backup and large file storage)

It's like having both a brilliant research assistant who remembers concepts and a filing cabinet for documents.

## Key Features of the Vector Database Server

### **Semantic Understanding**
Instead of just storing text, it stores **meaning**:
```python
# You can search for "handle errors in API calls"
# And it will find documents about try-catch blocks, exception handling, etc.
# Even if they don't contain those exact words!
```

### **11 Powerful Operations**
1. **create_collection** - Organize knowledge by topic
2. **add_documents** - Store new knowledge with automatic understanding
3. **search_similar** - Find related information using natural language
4. **get_documents** - Retrieve specific pieces of knowledge
5. **update_documents** - Modify existing knowledge
6. **delete_documents** - Remove outdated information
7. **count_documents** - Monitor collection sizes
8. **get_collection_info** - Inspect collection details
9. **delete_collection** - Remove entire knowledge areas
10. **backup_collection** - Preserve knowledge
11. **list_collections** - See all knowledge areas

### **Smart Organization**
```python
# Collections for different types of knowledge:
"code_patterns"       # Successful coding solutions
"project_context"     # Current project information  
"learning_history"    # What the AI has learned
"research_findings"   # External knowledge
"user_preferences"    # User-specific settings
```

## How This Transforms AGIcommander

### **Before** (without semantic memory):
- AI had to relearn patterns each session
- No way to build on previous successes
- Limited context about project history

### **After** (with vector database):
- AI remembers successful patterns and solutions
- Builds knowledge over time
- Can find related solutions even with vague descriptions
- Learns from every interaction

## Integration in Your Architecture

Your updated `pyproject.toml` now includes:

- **Core dependencies**: ChromaDB and sentence-transformers in main dependencies
- **Optional GPU acceleration**: Through the `vector-db` extra
- **Script entry point**: `vector-db-mcp-server` command
- **Plugin integration**: Automatic discovery by AGIcommander

## Example AGI Workflow

```python
# 1. Before starting a task, search for similar solutions
patterns = await vector_db.search_similar(
    collection_name="code_patterns",
    query="refactor large function into smaller components"
)

# 2. After successful completion, store the new knowledge
await vector_db.add_documents(
    collection_name="code_patterns", 
    documents=[successful_solution],
    metadata={
        "success_rate": 0.95,
        "user_satisfaction": "high",
        "pattern_type": "refactoring"
    }
)

# 3. During autonomous learning, build on existing knowledge
research = await vector_db.search_similar(
    collection_name="research_findings",
    query="latest AI coding best practices"
)
```

This vector database transforms AGIcommander from a **stateless AI** into a **learning, memory-enabled system** that gets smarter over time! It's a crucial step toward your AGI vision.
