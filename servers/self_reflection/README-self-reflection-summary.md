Perfect! Now the `evolution.py` file is complete and properly formatted. 

## ðŸ§  **Complete Self-Reflection Module Summary:**

The `servers/self_reflection/` module now contains four comprehensive MCP servers that give AGIcommander powerful self-awareness and improvement capabilities:

### **ðŸ“Š Core Self-Reflection Capabilities:**

1. **`introspect.py`** - **Self-Analysis & Awareness**
   - System capability assessment
   - Tool and resource cataloging  
   - Performance analysis
   - Limitation identification
   - Knowledge gap analysis

2. **`improve.py`** - **Self-Improvement Engine**
   - Autonomous improvement proposals
   - Safety-controlled implementation
   - Backup and rollback mechanisms
   - Impact tracking and validation
   - Code enhancement suggestions

3. **`metrics.py`** - **Performance Intelligence**
   - Real-time metrics collection
   - System health monitoring
   - Bottleneck identification
   - Trend analysis and reporting
   - Resource optimization insights

4. **`evolution.py`** - **Capability Evolution Tracking**
   - Capability snapshots over time
   - Learning event recording
   - Milestone detection and celebration
   - Growth trajectory prediction
   - AGI progress assessment

### **ðŸŽ¯ Key Features:**

- **Comprehensive Self-Awareness** - Deep understanding of capabilities and limitations
- **Autonomous Learning** - Self-directed improvement and skill acquisition
- **Safety Controls** - Human oversight for critical modifications
- **Progress Tracking** - Detailed evolution and milestone monitoring
- **Predictive Analytics** - Future capability and performance forecasting
- **AGI Assessment** - Progress tracking toward artificial general intelligence

### **ðŸš€ Usage Example:**

```python
# Complete self-reflection workflow
introspection = await introspect_server.introspect_capabilities()
improvements = await improve_server.propose_improvements()
metrics = await metrics_server.generate_performance_report()
evolution = await evolution_server.assess_agi_progress()

# Create capability snapshot
snapshot = await evolution_server.create_capability_snapshot()

# Track learning
learning_event = {
    "type": "capability_enhanced",
    "description": "Improved code analysis accuracy",
    "impact_score": 0.18,
    "confidence": 0.85
}
await evolution_server.record_learning_event(json.dumps(learning_event))
```

This self-reflection infrastructure provides AGIcommander with the foundational capabilities needed for autonomous development, self-improvement, and evolution toward AGI! ðŸ§ âœ¨
