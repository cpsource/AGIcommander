Yes! OpenSearch is definitely on GitHub. Here are the main URLs:

**Main OpenSearch Repository:**
https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch

**OpenSearch Project Organization (all repositories):**
https://github.com/opensearch-project

**Key Details:**
- OpenSearch is a community-driven, open source fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana following the license change in early 2021
- It's Apache 2.0-licensed and supported by The OpenSearch Software Foundation, a project of The Linux Foundation
- The project includes multiple repositories for different components like dashboards, plugins, documentation, and client libraries

**Note:** There's also an older, unrelated project at `https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch` which is about search protocols from 2005, but the modern search engine you're asking about is at the opensearch-project organization.

The main repository has the core search engine, while the organization hosts dozens of related projects including dashboards, plugins, client libraries for various languages, and documentation.
