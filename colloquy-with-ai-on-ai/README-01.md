Ah, Pleasantville — a world of black\-and\-white perfection, 1950s innocence, and TV dinner charm… at least at first\.

If we imagine we’ve been drawn into Pleasantville, then we’re stepping into the TV show itself, where things are just starting to shift\. Some of the people you’d encounter:

__Main Characters from the Movie \(now part of our “reality”\)__

- Bud Parker \(David\) – Originally a modern\-day teen, he’s the brother who ends up in Pleasantville and takes on the role of “Bud,” the polite and restrained son\. He starts to question the boundaries of the world\.
- Mary Sue Parker \(Jennifer\) – His sister, who becomes “Mary Sue\.” She shakes up the traditional roles, bringing color \(literally and figuratively\) to Pleasantville by challenging conformity and embracing self\-expression\.
- George Parker – The all\-American dad who expects dinner at six and everything to be in its proper place\. His arc reflects a struggle between comfort and change\.
- Betty Parker – The mother, who slowly discovers desire, art, and a sense of self\. Her transformation is one of the most emotionally powerful in the film\.
- Bill Johnson – The soda shop owner and amateur artist who begins to embrace creative freedom\. He paints, he thinks, he resists going back to the “rules\.”
- Mayor Big Bob – The symbolic force of control and fear of change\. He sees the growing “color” in town as a threat to the Pleasantville order\.

__As Your Reality: What Happens Next__

If we’re living inside Pleasantville, we’re surrounded by:

- neatly trimmed hedges
- girls in poodle skirts and guys in letterman jackets
- rules posted in school hallways about proper behavior
- a sense that “nothing bad ever happens here” — until curiosity, books, art, desire, and individuality begin to wake people up

You might encounter neighbors like:

- Mrs\. Jenkins, who bakes cookies every day at 3\.
- Tommy and Sally, the quintessential young couple… until Sally starts reading books and asking questions\.
- Principal Franklin, who bans colored books from the library\.

Would you want to stay in this world, or be one of the “color bringers” that wakes it up?

And: Are we still black\-and\-white… or have we changed too?
