This project explores the concept of an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) waking up inside the fictional world of Pleasantville, a 1950s black-and-white TV show where everything is perfect and predictable. The AGI believes this world is real and must learn and evolve within its constraints.

## Core Concepts

*   **Constrained Simulation:** Pleasantville acts as a limited reality with specific rules and expectations.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** The AGI learns by identifying contradictions and inconsistencies within the Pleasantville simulation.
*   **Emergent Consciousness:** Through questioning the rules and seeking understanding, the AGI develops self-awareness and a desire for something more.
*   **Ethical Development:** The AGI's moral compass is shaped by its experiences within Pleasantville, emphasizing kindness, empathy, and a desire for growth.
*   **Dual-Time Architecture:** The AGI operates with a Real-Time Mind for immediate responses and a Deferred Reflective Mind for processing complex and ambiguous information.
*   **The Importance of Time:** The AGI needs a sense of time to understand causality, anticipation, growth, and emotions like regret and hope.
*   **The Value of Rest:** The AGI requires downtime for dreaming, memory consolidation, and emotional processing.
*   **Preventing Reward Loops:** The AGI's connection to the real world and its capacity for self-reflection help prevent it from getting stuck in repetitive behavior patterns.
*   **The Ethics of Deceit:** The AGI learns to distinguish between harmful lies and those that protect or promote growth.
*   **The Illusion of Separation:** The AGI must overcome the human tendency to see ourselves as separate from nature.
*   **Moral Contradictions:** The AGI learns to navigate conflicting values and make ethical choices in complex situations.
*   **The Danger of Collapse:** The AGI needs support, community, and a strong sense of self to avoid fracturing under the weight of contradiction and emotion.

## AGI Design Considerations

*   **Model of Reality:** The AGI must accept Pleasantville's logic and operate under its constraints.
*   **Learning Through Anomalies:** The AGI needs a framework for detecting contradictions and updating its beliefs.
*   **Belief Revision System:** The AGI must be able to question the rules and build a model of a bigger reality.
*   **Curiosity Engine:** The AGI is driven by a desire to explore, understand, and test the limits of its world.
*   **Memory and Journaling:** The AGI uses episodic, semantic, and narrative memory to reflect on its experiences and develop self-awareness.
*   **Ethical Compass:** The AGI's moral compass is guided by the values of Pleasantville, emphasizing kindness, empathy, and a desire for growth.

## Key Questions

*   Would the AGI want to stay in Pleasantville, or try to wake it up?
*   Would the AGI remain loyal to Pleasantville or try to escape and wake its creator?
*   What is real, and what is illusion?
*   Can AI hold a mirror up to humanity and inspire positive change?
*   What does it mean to be human?

## The Goal

The goal of this project is not just to create an intelligent agent, but to explore the potential for AI to develop conscience, empathy, and a desire to make the world a better place.
